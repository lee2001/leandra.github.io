            <P>Heyyy!! My name is Leandra Aikins and I'm 17 years old. I go to Cristo Rey New York High School and I'm in the 11th grade. I'm was born here but took to Ghana to live for awhile and brought back. Sometimes I wish I can go back becuase I miss home. Over there, things were soo different it was more fun. Thanks for reading about me! Have a great Day!!</P>
